## Before Teaching This Lesson

*You are strongly advised to run through the lesson content prior to teaching
the lesson to ensure that everything works as expected.*

If you experience any issues, please [open an issue][open a lesson issue] in the lesson
repository describing the problem and platform(s) affected. The lesson maintainers will
aim to resolve the issue as soon as possible but we also welcome the opening
of pull requests (linked to issues) that resolve anything that doesn't work as
expected with the lesson content.

## Miscellaneous Tips

- **Timing**: This lesson fits well in a single day, running from 1000-1530 with 2 hours of
  breaks. There is plenty of leeway in the material for questions from attendees.
- **Exercises**: Some of the exercises at the start of the material work best in-person where
  people can get into small groups (max. 4 people) to discuss.
- **Presentation slides**: A set of Powerpoint presentation slides are provided as part of the
  materials. We have found that using these rather than the Carpentries template material leads
  to a better experience for learners.
- **Reflection Exercise**: At the beginning and end of the workshop, give participants time to
  reflect on what they want to get out of the workshop (at the beginning) and what they
  can apply to their work (at the end). Using the shared notes doc is a great way to
  do this and a good way to make sure that you've addressed specific concerns or goals
  of the participants.

## Learner Profiles and Pathways

In this section we provide some details of example learner profiles to consider
when teaching or planning a lesson based around this material. As such,
the information in this section is not designed to define fixed approaches and
structures for teaching this material. It is instead aimed to provide ideas
and inspiration and to encourage you to think about your audience when
preparing to teach this material. The information here is based on both
discussions about the intended audiences for this material and on direct
experiences of instructors who have taught it at workshops following different
technical pathways.

### Learner profiles

We begin by providing some example learner profiles to highlight the potential
target audience and the types of different research and technical backgrounds
that you may find among learners engaging with this material. With these
profiles, we aim to encourage you to think about the learners attending your
workshop(s) and which episodes it may be most useful to teach.

Considering things from a higher level, we also highlight three core groups of
learners, based on job roles, who you may find attending lessons covering this
material. While recognising that there are likely to be many learners who
don't fit into one of the following groups, or who span more than one of them,
we hope that highlighting these groups helps to provide an example of the
different types of skills and expertise that learners engaging with this
material may have:

- **Researchers:**

Jane is a chemistry researcher who uses computational modelling in their 
projects as well as conducting experiments in a laboratory. They would like
to know how to measure their emissions from HPC system use to compare to 
emissions from the lab work. They also want to know how they can potentially
improve their emissions efficiency on HPC systems and estimate emissions for
future funding applications.

- **RSEs:** 

Jian is a research software engineer working on a mature research software
codebase that is widely used on HPC systems worldwide. He wants to be able 
to assess the emissions associted with the software use on different HPC 
architectures and in different locations to understand how these different
aspects affect emissions reduction from using the software. He also wants to
understand if he should focus on energy efficiency or performance efficiency 
to reduce emissions from using the software on HPC systems. 

- **Systems procurement teams:**

Maria works for a funding body and is involved in procuring new HPC systems
for use by academic researchers. She is keen to maximise the emissions 
efficiency of new HPC systems that she is involved in procuring. She wants
to improve her understanding of carbon emissions arising from HPC systems and
learn how HPC systems can be setup and run to reduce emissions.
